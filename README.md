# Roman3D: 3 DOF Robotic Manipulator

## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary components for constructing and operating a 3 DOF planar robotic manipulator experiment setup. The project includes a CAD model of the robot, embedded code for the data acquisition card, the circuit design for the card, and a MATLAB project template.

## Contents

- `CAD/`: Contains the CAD model files for the robot.
- `EmbeddedCode/`: Contains the embedded code for the data acquisition card.
- `CircuitDesign/`: Contains the circuit design files for the data acquisition card.
- `MATLABProject/`: Contains the MATLAB project template for running the experiment.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

- [List the required hardware components]
- Data acquisition card
- [Any other required components]

### Software

- MATLAB (version X.X or later)
- [Any additional software dependencies]

## Setup Instructions

### Hardware Setup

1. Assemble the robot using the provided CAD model files (`CAD/` directory).
2. Construct the data acquisition card according to the circuit design files (`CircuitDesign/` directory).
3. Connect the data acquisition card to the robot and any other necessary components.

### Software Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robotic-experiment-setup.git
    cd robotic-experiment-setup
    ```

2. Open the MATLAB project template located in the `MATLABProject/` directory.
3. Load the embedded code onto the data acquisition card using the instructions provided in the `EmbeddedCode/` directory.

## Usage
